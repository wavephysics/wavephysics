- 👋 Hi, I’m Omar Boughdad, Ph.D. in optics/nonlinear optics
- 👀 I’m interested in the propagation of a light beam into nonlinear media (kerr, electro-optic (pockels)...), Optical diffraction using (DOE), Optical Neural network, Holography... 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to simulate light propagation into linear and nonlinear media (including multimode fibers) and optical neural network.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the fields cited earlier.
- 📫 How to reach me o.boughdad@gmail.com
